## REST
RESTful web application enables the client to take actions on server resources, 
such as create new resources (i.e. create a new user) or 
change existing resources (i.e. edit a post).
###  Idempotent
clients can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result.
POST -> Not Idempotent, Otherwise all are Idempotent
Both PUT and POST can be used for creating.

## DI 
Constructor injection (the good) -> for mandatory feild
Setter injection (the ugly) 		-> for optional feild, Setter Injection Make Testing Easy
Field injection (the bad)	-> head to use outside of spring container, Field Injection, a Unit Test Dies

@Configuration -> indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container 
				  as a source of bean definitions.
@Bean -> annotation tells Spring that a method annotated with @Bean will return an object
		that should be registered as a bean in the Spring application context

## GC

1. Prevent causing OutOfMemoryErrors.
2. Main objective of Garbage Collector is to free heap memory

We can also request JVM to run Garbage Collector. There are two ways to do it :
1. Using System.gc() method : System class contain static method gc() for requesting JVM to run Garbage Collector.
2. Using Runtime.getRuntime().gc() method : Runtime class allows the application to interface with the JVM in which the application is running. Hence by using its gc() method, we can request JVM to run Garbage Collector.

-Finalize method

It is a method that Garbage Collector always calls just before 
destroying the object which is eligible for Garbage Collection,
so as to perform clean-up activity. Clean-up activity means 
closing the resources associated with that object like Database
Connection, Network Connection or we can say resource de-allocation.
Remember it is not a reserved keyword.
Once finalize method completes immediately Garbage Collector
destroy that object. finalize method is present in Object class
The finalize() method called by Garbage Collector not JVM. 
Although Garbage Collector is one of the module of JVM.

## Thread

-Daemon thread

Daemon thread is a low priority thread that runs in background 
to perform tasks such as garbage collection.

Properties:

1. They can not prevent the JVM from exiting when all the user threads 
finish their execution.
2. JVM terminates itself when all user threads finish their execution
3. If JVM finds running daemon thread, it terminates the thread 
and after that shutdown itself. JVM does not care whether Daemon 
thread is running or not.
4. It is an utmost low priority thread.

- Polling
The process of testing a condition repeatedly till it becomes true is known as polling.
If it is true, certain action is taken. This waste many CPU cycles and makes the implementation inefficient.
To avoid polling, Java uses three methods, namely, wait(), notify() and notifyAll()
They must be used within a synchronized block only.

Thread methods how works internally 

1. wait() - It tells the calling thread to give up the lock and go to sleep until some other thread enters the same monitor and calls notify().

2. notify() - It wakes up one single thread that called wait() on the same object. It should be noted that calling notify() does not actually give up a lock on a resource.

3. notifyAll() - It wakes up all the threads that called wait() on the same object.

4. join() - thread1.join() => put thread1 running. only when thread1 finished 
its execution then next thread will start to execute.
5. yield() - Suppose there are three threads t1, t2, and t3. Thread t1 gets the processor and starts its execution and thread t2 and t3 are in Ready/Runnable state. Completion time for thread t1 is 5 hour and completion time for t2 is 5 minutes. Since t1 will complete its execution after 5 hours, t2 has to wait for 5 hours to just finish 5 minutes job. In such scenarios where one thread is taking too much time to complete its execution, we need a way to prevent execution of a thread in between if something important is pending. yeild() helps us in doing so.
yield() basically means that the thread is not doing anything particularly important and if any other threads or processes need to be run, they should run. Otherwise, the current thread will continue to run.

6. sleep() - This method causes the currently executing thread to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds, subject to the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers. The argument value for milliseconds canâ€™t be negative, else it throws IllegalArgumentException.
Thread.sleep() is used to pause the main thread execution for 2 seconds.
Any other thread can interrupt the current thread in sleep, in that case InterruptedException is thrown.
